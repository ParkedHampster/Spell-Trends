# Spell-Trends

A natural language processing analysis of Magic: the
Gathering abilities as compared to their relative
prices, foil and non-foil.

The main dataset for this project was obtained from
[ScryFall](https://scryfall.com/)
at
[their bulk data page](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data),
specifically the All Cards JSON file.

Data for pricing (and the data to translate back to
Scryfall usability) was obtained from
[MtGJson](https://mtgjson.com/)
at
[their download page here](https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/),
specifically the "AllPrintings" and "AllPrices" files.
This data is maintained and refreshed on a dail basis,
looking back at a 90-day period. At the sources
mentioned, there is not additional data available
retroactively.
