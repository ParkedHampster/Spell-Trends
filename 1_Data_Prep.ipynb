    "## Data Sourcing and Authority\n",
    "\n",
    "The main dataset for this project was obtained from\n",
    "[ScryFall](https://scryfall.com/)\n",
    "at\n",
    "[their bulk data page](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data),\n",
    "specifically the All Cards JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for pricing (and the data to translate back to\n",
    "Scryfall usability) was obtained from\n",
    "[MtGJson](https://mtgjson.com/)\n",
    "at\n",
    "[their download page here](https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/),\n",
    "specifically the \"AllPrintings\" and \"AllPrices\" files.\n",
    "This data is maintained and refreshed on a dail basis,\n",
    "looking back at a 90-day period. At the sources\n",
    "mentioned, there is not additional data available\n",
    "retroactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Scryfall](https://scryfall.com)\n",
    "is one of the most robust search and sorting\n",
    "databases available for Magic and is used by many\n",
    "different applications. They have easily and freely\n",
    "available data for most cases. This data set includes\n",
    "the vast majority of features that will be utilized in\n",
    "this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Scryfall is very robust, the pricing data that it\n",
    "provides isn't quite what we want to look at. It does\n",
    "feature a price column, but it's only a snapshot of a\n",
    "single day and wouldn't be insulated from price spikes.\n",
    "While, in theory, this data could be collected daily\n",
    "over the course of weeks or months, this also isn't\n",
    "held historically. Because of this, we'll utilize\n",
    "[MtGJson](https://mtgjson.com)\n",
    "and the available \"All Prices\" data set that is\n",
    "available there, as it contains prices from a 90-day\n",
    "period, which should allow us to better insulate from\n",
    "random spikes in prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to pair our data sets together, we need to get\n",
    "the card IDs from the All Prices data set and get the\n",
    "related Scryfall ID for each card. For this, we need\n",
    "to use another data set from\n",
    "[MtGJson](https://mtgjson.com)\n",
    "that has all of the IDs that may be related to a card.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prices available in both the Scryfall data and the\n",
    "MtGJson data that we'll be looking at are prices from\n",
    "[TCGPlayer](https://tcgplayer.com),\n",
    "specifically the \"Retail\" or market prices. These\n",
    "prices are made up of the mean prices of actual sales\n",
    "that are made on the platform rather than the prices\n",
    "that cards are listed at. Since TCGPlayer is the\n",
    "largest online marketplace for Magic cards in the\n",
    "United States, this data should be some of the most\n",
    "accurate available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from\n",
    "[MtGJson](https://mtgjson.com)\n",
    "also has prices from Card Kingdom, CardMarket, and some\n",
    "others, but these prices are usually notoriously\n",
    "higher, for foreign markets, or otherwise less\n",
    "available for various reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the pricing data we're looking at will\n",
    "only be for paper Magic, at least for the initial scope\n",
    "of this project, though MtG:O pricing may be a target\n",
    "at a later date.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for my own authority on this data, I've been an avid\n",
    "Magic player for almost a decade at this point. I've\n",
    "been consistently buying and trading cards since early\n",
    "2014 and have had several interpersonal relationships\n",
    "with people that have made a business of the Magic\n",
    "market in all categories of it.\n",
    "\n",

    "be adapted or changed over the project's course. As\n",
    "these features are added or removed, justification will\n",
    "be provided either before the relevant code block or\n",
